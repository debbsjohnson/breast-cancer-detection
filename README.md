🔍 Breast Cancer Detection Project: Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Building 🔍

Exciting news! 🌟 Fresh off completing the Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning course on IBM, I dove into a meaningful project focusing on Breast Cancer Detection. Breast cancer affects millions worldwide, making early detection pivotal. Here's a glimpse into the key steps taken in this project:



1️⃣ Data Loading and Cleaning:

We start by loading the breast cancer dataset, performing data cleaning, and understanding its structure using descriptive statistics.

2️⃣ Binary Encoding:

Categorical variables like "M" (Malignant) and "B" (Benign) are converted to numerical values (1 and 0) for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

3️⃣ Feature Selection:

Using correlation analysis and heatmap visualization, we identify the most relevant features that explain the relationship between independent variables and the target variable (diagnosis).

4️⃣ Visualization:

We create pair plots and correlation matrices for better visualization of relationships between selected features, helping us understand patterns and potential insights.

5️⃣ Feature Scaling:

Normalization and standardization are applied to ensure all features have the same scale, a crucial step for many machine learning algorithms.

6️⃣ Handling Outliers:

Outliers are identified and removed to enhance the robustness of our model.

7️⃣ Feature Extraction with PCA:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce dimensionality while retaining relevant information. We then build a logistic regression model using the extracted features.

8️⃣ Model Evaluation:

Our model achieves an accuracy of 97.37% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying breast tumors.

🚀 Conclusion:

The EDA process lays the foundation for a robust breast cancer detection model. Continuous improvement and refinement can be made based on additional insights and model evaluation metrics.
